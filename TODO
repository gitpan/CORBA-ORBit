Language Mapping Issues
=======================

- Support for WChar and WString (should be possible even though
  ORBit doesn't support them itself)


POA Issues
==========

- Fix/finish the non-default policies within ORBit

- Add missing functions to ORBit.xs


Interface Repository Interface
==============================

- Finish the ORBit interface repository

- write the necessary code to convert ORBit C anys to constants
  so that we can retrieve constant declarations from the
  interface repository.


General Tasks
=============

- Figure out how to get Perl to talk to C in the same process
  (almost certainly requires some ORBit changes)

Test Suite
==========

- Write a test suite; this should be a lot easier now with
  the ability to read from .idl files than it was for 
  the MICO module, where we had to fire up a interface repository
  and feed it. All you need to do is make your testing
  client program start the server program, which can write
  the IOR to standard out.

BUGS
====

- Raising a invalid exception propagates back a CORBA::UNKNOWN except
with junk parameters.
