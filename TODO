Language Mapping Issues
=======================

- Support for WChar and WString (should be possible even though
  ORBit doesn't support them itself)


POA Issues
==========

- Fix/finish the non-default policies within ORBit

- Add missing functions to ORBit.xs


Interface Repository Interface
==============================

- Finish the ORBit interface repository

- write the necessary code to convert ORBit C anys to constants
  so that we can retrieve constant declarations from the
  interface repository.


General Tasks
=============

- Figure out how to get Perl to talk to C in the same process
  (almost certainly requires some ORBit changes)






BUGS
====

- Raising a invalid exception propagates back a CORBA::UNKNOWN except
with junk parameters.
