Sun Jan  2 19:52:13 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Released 0.3.0

	* Account.idl: Fix stupid left-in debugging change.

	* README (CORBA): Up version number. Add more information
	about ORBit dependencies.

Tue Jan  4 03:19:59 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* demarshal.c (porbit_get_exception): Fix bug in
	demarshalling system exceptions.

	* server.c (porbit_call_method): Fix leak of stack space
	for operations returning void.

	* server.c (call_implementation): Add a SAVETMPS/FREETMPS
	around method calls, otherwise we leak like a sieve.
	(Could also avoid mortalizing outside of our method calls,
	I think.)

	* ORBit.pm (import): Handle absolute pathnames correctly.

Tue Dec  7 13:56:33 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* idl.c (porbit_parse_idl_file): Add the IDLF_TYPECODES
	flag so that typecodes are understood.

	  g_main.

	* idl.c marshal.c demarshal.c: Add support for fixed.

Tue Sep 21 22:53:40 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* idl.c: Add names into struct/enum/except/etc. typecodes
	because the marshalling code in ORBit expects them
	(spec says that "" would be valid, so we could use
	that, but NULL segfaults).

	* marshal.c demarshal.c ORBit.pm: Add support for Anys.

	* ORBit.xs interfaces.c: Provide an interface for
	creating TypeCodes.

	* client.c: Split stubs into a separate file.

	operations.
