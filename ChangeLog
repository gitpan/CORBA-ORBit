Sat Mar 25 14:47:54 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Released 0.4.0

Fri Mar 24 12:41:54 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* errors.c (porbit_system_except): Deal with the fact
	that ORBit uses IDL:CORBA in its system exception names instead
	of IDL:omg.org/CORBA.

	* demarshal.c (porbit_get_exception): Hack around incorrect
	marshalling of system exceptions by ORBit.

	* marshal.c (put_objref): Check outgoing object references
	against the typecode. There are some problems here if
	the object we are marshalling is not a local object and
	we don't have compete type information. Perhaps this
	check should only be for local object references?

	* server.c: Add more detailed information in warning
	messages about the location where errors occur.

Wed Mar 22 15:44:51 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

        * Released 0.3.9
	
	* ORBit.pm: Temporarily disable dereferencing 
	ORB, POA, POAManager, since ORBit is broken when 
	doing so.

	* server client: Add test for creating and destroying servants
	on the fly.

	* ORBit.xs server.[ch]: Remove pin table, which was
	no longer used for useful purposes. (We were already
	storing the information in the servant.) Implicitely
	reference active servants so it isn't necessary for
	for applications to keep references to such servants
	themselves.

Tue Mar 14 11:16:35 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* idl.c (porbit_parse_idl_file): Define __ORBIT_IDL__
	when parsing, to allow people to #define around 
	libIDL pecularities in IDL files. (Michael Meeks)

	* idl.c (do_operation): Advance properly to the next
	exception when iterating over exceptions. (Pointed
	out by Jason Tackaberry.)

Sun Jan  2 19:52:13 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Released 0.3.0

	* Account.idl: Fix stupid left-in debugging change.

	* README (CORBA): Up version number. Add more information
	about ORBit dependencies.

Tue Jan  4 03:19:59 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* demarshal.c (porbit_get_exception): Fix bug in
	demarshalling system exceptions.

	* server.c (porbit_call_method): Fix leak of stack space
	for operations returning void.

	* server.c (call_implementation): Add a SAVETMPS/FREETMPS
	around method calls, otherwise we leak like a sieve.
	(Could also avoid mortalizing outside of our method calls,
	I think.)

	* ORBit.pm (import): Handle absolute pathnames correctly.

Tue Dec  7 13:56:33 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* idl.c (porbit_parse_idl_file): Add the IDLF_TYPECODES
	flag so that typecodes are understood.
	(From Michael Meeks <mmeeks@gnu.org>)

Fri Oct  8 01:08:26 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Released 0.2.0.

	* porbit-perl.h (PL_sv_undef): Add additional compatibility
	defines.

Mon Sep 27 23:31:41 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* ORBit.xs: Made orb->run()/shutdown(), etc, use
	  g_main.

	* idl.c marshal.c demarshal.c: Add support for fixed.

Tue Sep 21 22:53:40 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* idl.c: Add names into struct/enum/except/etc. typecodes
	because the marshalling code in ORBit expects them
	(spec says that "" would be valid, so we could use
	that, but NULL segfaults).

	* marshal.c demarshal.c ORBit.pm: Add support for Anys.

	* ORBit.xs interfaces.c: Provide an interface for
	creating TypeCodes.

	* client.c: Split stubs into a separate file.
	
	* interfaces.c server.c: Add support for oneway
	operations.

Sun Sep 19 04:24:13 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Started ChangeLog in preparation for a 0.1.0 release.
